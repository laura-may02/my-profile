		<h2>Ecology</h2>
			<p> Ecology is first and foremost a science, a science that must be taught to children. We must protect our children by leaving them a healthy planet. 
			It is time to help those who are trying to do everything to save our planet Earth. We are all responsible for its condition. We can all improve its current state and without much effort. </p>

		<h2> Green car developmentüçÉ </h2>
			<p> Opting for an electric vehicle means choosing a car that is environmentally friendly and less polluting to run, but also quieter to help reduce noise pollution and therefore improve our health thanks to the absence of CO2 emissions. </p>
